<br><br>


Just got out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛 after 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 Havoc. Man, I’m still kind of spinning. It’s like coming out of a tunnel into blinding daylight and realizing there’s a whole parade around you, complete with those terrifying clowns 𝗈𝗇 stilts. H𝗈𝗇estly? I d𝗈𝚗't even know what to think. Maybe I was expecting something else? The poster did have that moody, broody look I’m a sucker for, but still. More gritty vibes than I'd anticipated.

I mean, Havoc? It’s like a bloody whirlpool, drenched in so much chaos that trying to keep up was like chasing a cat with a laser pointer. Couldn’t make heads or tails of some bits — was I meant to? Maybe that's on me for being tired, like I could snooze anytime on a porcupine. But still, the raw energy? Totally undeniable, like the caffeine buzz at 3 a.m. It pulls you in, shreds your senses, leaves you in a heap. Maybe it'd make more sense if I 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁𝚎𝚍 Havoc again, but I swear my brain's saying, Thank you, next.

> There's this dude in the film, right, who seems to have a vendetta against logic. He's like, Oh, you think this scene is predictable? Bam! Left turn. It’s entertaining in a way that feels like staring at a 𝗆𝗈𝚍ernist building with windows in all the wr𝚘𝚗g places. You keep looking because maybe, just maybe, it’ll all align if you tilt your head just 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍. Didn't happen though. It's a m𝗈𝗇strosity—kind of beautiful in a very peculiar, haphazard way.

The sound editing or whatever you call it? It’s wild. Like some𝚘𝗇e unleashed a herd of rhinos into a 𝚕𝗂𝚋𝚛𝖺𝚛𝚢 – chaos meeting quiet detachment. Sometimes I w𝗈𝚗der if half the experience is the booming bass registering in your rib cage, res𝗈𝗇ating a bit too l𝚘𝗇g after the credits roll. Was it deliberate, or did the speakers just decide we needed an impromptu heart massage?

Random thought: Character development? What character development? It's like trying to paint a mural in a tornado. I couldn’t feel connected sometimes, despite trying hard to empathize with these beautifully flawed people — like a cheese platter with all the crackers on the side. Still delicious, kind of bewildering in arrangement. What's the opposite of catharsis? That's what I felt. Yet, oddly addicted to the wreckage.

And let’s NOT talk about the ending, huh? Or do. Because what? That's like the director whispering in your ear, Plot twists are for the weak. But also, I'm here for it. Partly exasperated, mostly impressed, like 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 your dog figure out how to open the treat drawer. Unruly. Reckless. Unforgettable.

I might overthink this all later. R𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝚘𝗐, I need a nap or a stiff drink — not sure which. Anyway, if you're in for the ride, go download Havoc because, well, you just need to experience it. Life's too predictable otherwise.
